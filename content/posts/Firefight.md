This was my AiE student major work for year 2 Game Design, Advanced Diploma. We took on the challenge of building a two player co-operative game in a short amount of time and it proved to be a fun learning experience that has provided me useful skills for the future. 

The objective is to escape a burning building. There are two characters: Charlie, who wields an Axe and August who wields a fire hose.
